I am excited to share that there is new version of Sim8085 in development right now. I have been thinking about this rewrite for some time as
I have started to see the number of users rising. There have been people, both students and professors reaching out to me from various
colleges/universities.

The old code built over two months works but now the need is to update the technology and also incorporate all
the feedback that I have got for last few years.

## What will it look like? üé®

Here is basic design that I created with my limited design skills. I will use this as a starting point and adapt while developing.

## Tech Stack ü§ñ

The first version of the app was developed not only for providing a great 8085 learning experience but also for my learning of various
technologies such as, Elm and asm.js. The new stack is geared more towards stability and familiarity, so that people can easily
contribute to the project. I am moving away from C (and asm.js) and Elm towards Rust (with WASM) and React. The app will still work
completely on the browser without any need of server. The full stack is,

### Emulator
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
- [WASM](https://webassembly.org/) (using [wasm-bindgen](https://rustwasm.github.io/docs/wasm-bindgen/))

### Assembler
- [PEG.js](https://pegjs.org)

### Frontend
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) (using [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/))
- [Redux](https://redux.js.org/)
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Blueprint](https://blueprintjs.com/)
- [Codemirror](https://codemirror.net/)

## Progress ‚è≥

Over the last few weeks I have migrated the C code completely to Rust and now have it working. The next step is rebuilding the UI
which I have just started.

The trick is making time for development out of my day job work üòÖ
